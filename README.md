# Nuclei Finder
Find nuclei from images using deep learning. 

This project is being done in conjunction with Elizabeth Silvermetz, P.h.D student at Weizmann Institute. 
The goal of this project is to automate the finding of nuclei in images of cells, which is a timely process when done by humans.

## Sample Image
Below is in a sample image of nuclei cells in bounding boxes.

## Files
- make_bounds.py opens the images in the 'images' folder (one at a time) and allows the user to register the coordinates (a bounding box) around all the nuclei using the mouse
